**Point**

Write a class to represent a pont in 2D space.

The class needs to have 2 constructs, one is empty and the other has two parameters x and y.

Make the normal getters and setters etc.

1. Method distance without any parameters that returns the distance of (x, y) from Point(0, 0).
2. Method distance with two parameters(x, y), it needs to return the distance between this Point and Point(x, y).
3. Method distance with parameter another Point that returns the distance between the two points.
